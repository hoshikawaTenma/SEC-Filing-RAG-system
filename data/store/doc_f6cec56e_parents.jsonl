The Company\u2019s reportable segments consist of the\nAmericas, Europe, Greater China, Japan and Rest of Asia Pacific. Americas includes both North and South America. Europe\nincludes European countries, as well as India, the Middle East and Africa. Greater China includes China mainland, Hong Kong\nand Taiwan. Rest of Asia Pacific includes Australia, New Zealand and those Asian countries not included in the Company\u2019s other\nreportable segments. Although the reportable segments provide similar hardware and software products and similar services,\neach one is managed separately to better align with the location of the Company\u2019s customers and distribution partners and the\nunique market dynamics of each geographic region.\nMarkets and Distribution\nThe Company\u2019s customers are primarily in the consumer, small and mid-sized business, education, enterprise and government\nmarkets. The Company sells its products and resells third-party products in most of its major markets directly to customers\nthrough its retail and online stores and its direct sales force. The Company sells its services in the same markets through its\nvarious service platforms. The Company also employs a variety of indirect distribution channels, such as third-party cellular\nnetwork carriers and other resellers, for the sale of its products and certain of its services. During 2025, the Company\u2019s net sales\nthrough its direct and indirect distribution channels accounted for 40% and 60%, respectively, of total net sales.\nCompetition\nThe markets for the Company\u2019s products and services are highly competitive and are characterized by aggressive price\ncompetition, downward pressure on gross margins, continual improvement in product performance, and price sensitivity on the\npart of consumers and businesses. The markets in which the Company competes are further defined by frequent introduction of\nnew products and services, short product life cycles, evolving industry standards, and rapid adoption of technological\nadvancements by competitors. Many of the Company\u2019s competitors seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and\nvery low cost structures, and by imitating the Company\u2019s products and infringing on its intellectual property.\nApple Inc. | 2025 Form 10-K | 2"}
{"parent_id": "parent_7407087c", "doc_id": "doc_f6cec56e", "parent_type": "page", "title": "Page 6", "page_number": 6, "section_path": null, "text": "The Company\u2019s ability to compete successfully depends heavily on ensuring the continuing and timely introduction of innovative\nnew products, services and technologies to the marketplace. The Company designs and develops nearly the entire solution for\nits products, including the hardware, operating system, numerous software applications and related services. Principal\ncompetitive factors important to the Company include price, product and service features (including security features), relative\nprice and performance, product and service quality and reliability, design and technology innovation, a strong third-party software\nand accessories ecosystem, marketing and distribution capability, service and support, corporate reputation, and the ability to\neffectively protect and enforce the Company\u2019s intellectual property rights.\nThe Company is focused on expanding its market opportunities related to smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables\nand accessories, and services. The Company\u2019s products and services face substantial competition from companies that have\nsignificant technical, marketing, distribution and other resources, as well as established hardware, software, and service offerings\nwith large customer bases. In addition, the Company faces significant competition as competitors imitate the Company\u2019s product\nfeatures and applications within their products to offer more competitive solutions. The Company also expects competition to\nintensify as competitors imitate the Company\u2019s approach to providing components seamlessly within their offerings or work\ncollaboratively to offer integrated solutions. Some of the Company\u2019s competitors have broad product lines, low-priced products,\nlarge installed bases of active devices, and large customer bases. Competition has been particularly intense as competitors have\naggressively cut prices and lowered product margins. Certain competitors have the resources, experience or cost structures to\nprovide products and services at little or no profit or even at a loss. The Company has a minority market share in the global\nsmartphone, personal computer, tablet and wearables markets, and some of the markets in which the Company competes have\nfrom time to time experienced little to no growth or contracted overall.\nSupply of Components\nAlthough most components essential to the Company\u2019s business are generally available from multiple sources, certain\ncomponents are currently obtained from single or limited sources. The Company also competes for various components with\nother participants in the markets for smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables and accessories. Therefore, many\ncomponents used by the Company, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide\nshortage and significant commodity pricing fluctuations. Restrictions on international trade can increase the cost or limit the\navailability of the Company\u2019s products and the components and rare earths and other raw materials that go into them.\nThe Company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitors, and new products introduced by\nthe Company often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new\ntechnologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers\u2019 yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have\nincreased. The Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components; however, the Company may not be\nable to extend or renew agreements for the supply of components on similar terms, or at all, and may not be successful in\nobtaining sufficient quantities from its suppliers or in a timely manner, or in identifying and obtaining sufficient quantities from an\nalternative source. In addition, component suppliers may fail, be subject to consolidation within a particular industry, or decide to\nconcentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company\u2019s requirements,\nfurther limiting the Company\u2019s ability to obtain sufficient quantities of components on commercially reasonable terms, or at all.\nResearch and Development\nBecause the industries in which the Company competes are characterized by rapid technological advances, the Company\u2019s\nability to compete successfully depends heavily upon its ability to ensure a continual and timely flow of competitive products,\nservices and technologies to the marketplace. The Company continues to develop new technologies to enhance existing\nproducts and services, and to expand the range of its offerings through research and development (\u201cR&D\u201d), licensing of\nintellectual property and acquisition of third-party businesses and technology.\nIntellectual Property\nThe Company currently holds a broad collection of intellectual property rights relating to certain aspects of its hardware, software\nand services. This includes patents, designs, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets and other forms of intellectual property rights\nin the U.S. and various foreign countries. Although the Company believes the ownership of such intellectual property rights is an\nimportant factor in differentiating its business and that its success does depend in part on such ownership, the Company relies\nprimarily on the innovative skills, technical competence and marketing abilities of its personnel.\nThe Company regularly files patent, design, copyright and trademark applications to protect innovations arising from its\nhardware, software and service research, development, design and marketing, and is currently pursuing thousands of\napplications around the world. Over time, the Company has accumulated a large portfolio of issued and registered intellectual\nproperty rights around the world. No single intellectual property right is solely responsible for protecting the Company\u2019s products\nand services. The Company believes the duration of its intellectual property rights is adequate relative to the expected lives of its\nproducts and services.\nApple Inc. | 2025 Form 10-K | 3"}

It may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating\nto various aspects of the Company\u2019s products, processes and services. While the Company has generally been able to obtain\nsuch licenses on commercially reasonable terms in the past, there is no guarantee that such licenses could be obtained in the\nfuture on reasonable terms or at all.\nBusiness Seasonality and Product Introductions\nThe Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in\npart to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales, cost of\nsales and operating expenses. The timing of product introductions can also impact the Company\u2019s net sales to its indirect\ndistribution channels as these channels are filled with new inventory following a product launch, and channel inventory of an\nolder product often declines as the launch of a newer product approaches. Net sales can also be affected when consumers and\ndistributors anticipate a product introduction.\nHuman Capital\nThe Company believes that its people play an important role in its success, and strives to attract, develop and retain the best\ntalent. The Company works to create a culture of collaboration, one where people with a broad range of backgrounds and\nperspectives can come together to innovate and do the best work of their lives. The Company is an equal opportunity employer\ncommitted to inclusion and to providing a workplace free of harassment or discrimination. As of September 27, 2025, the\nCompany had approximately 166,000 full-time equivalent employees.\nThe Company believes that compensation should be competitive and equitable, and offers discretionary cash and equity awards\nto enable employees to share in the Company\u2019s success. The Company recognizes its people are most likely to thrive when they\nhave the resources to meet their needs and the time and support to succeed in their professional and personal lives. In support\nof this, the Company offers a wide variety of benefits for employees around the world, including health, wellness and time away.\nThe Company invests in resources to help its people develop and achieve their career goals. The Company offers programs\nthrough Apple University on leadership, management and influence, as well as Apple culture and values. Team members can\nalso take advantage of online classes for business, technical and personal development.\nThe Company believes that open and honest communication among team members, managers and leaders helps create an\nopen, collaborative work environment where everyone can contribute, grow and succeed. Team members are encouraged to\ncome to their managers with questions, feedback or concerns, and the Company conducts surveys that gauge employee\nsentiment in areas like career development, manager performance and inclusion.\nThe Company is committed to the safety and security of its team members everywhere it operates. The Company supports\nemployees with general safety, security and crisis management training, and by putting specific programs in place for those\nworking in potentially high-hazard environments.\nAvailable Information\nThe Company\u2019s Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and\namendments to reports filed pursuant to Sections 13(a) and 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended\n(\u201cExchange Act\u201d), are filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d).

Potential outcomes include financial instability; inability to obtain credit to finance business operations; and\ninsolvency.\nAdverse economic conditions can also lead to increased credit and collectibility risk on the Company\u2019s trade receivables; the\nfailure of derivative counterparties and other financial institutions; limitations on the Company\u2019s ability to issue new debt; reduced\nliquidity; and declines in the fair values of the Company\u2019s financial instruments.

The impact can be particularly significant if these restrictive measures apply to countries\nand regions where the Company derives a significant portion of its revenues and/or has significant supply chain operations.\nRestrictive measures can increase the cost or limit the availability of the Company\u2019s products and the components and rare\nearths and other raw materials that go into them. Restrictive measures can also require the Company to change suppliers,\nrestructure business relationships and operations, refrain from offering and distributing or cease to offer and distribute affected\nproducts, services and third-party applications to its customers, and increase the prices of its products and services. Changing\nthe Company\u2019s business and supply chain in accordance with new or changed restrictions on international trade can be\nexpensive, time-consuming and disruptive to the Company\u2019s business and results of operations. Trade and other international\ndisputes can also have an adverse impact on the overall macroeconomic environment and result in shifts and reductions in\nconsumer spending and negative consumer sentiment for the Company\u2019s products and services, all of which can further\nadversely affect the Company\u2019s business and results of operations. Such restrictions can be announced with little or no advance\nnotice, which can create uncertainty, and the Company may not be able to effectively mitigate any or all adverse impacts from\nsuch measures. Global supply chains can be highly concentrated, and an escalation of geopolitical tensions or conflict could\nresult in significant disruptions. Beginning in the second quarter of 2025, new tariffs were announced on imports to the U.S.\n(\u201cU.S. Tariffs\u201d), including additional tariffs on imports from China, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Vietnam and the European\nUnion (\u201cEU\u201d), among others. In response, several countries have imposed, or threatened to impose, reciprocal tariffs on imports\nfrom the U.S. and other retaliatory measures. Various modifications to the U.S. Tariffs have been announced and further\nchanges could be made in the future, which may include additional sector-based tariffs or other measures. For example, the U.S.\nDepartment of Commerce has initiated an investigation under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended,\ninto, among other things, imports of semiconductors, semiconductor manufacturing equipment, and their derivative products,\nincluding downstream products that contain semiconductors. The ultimate impact remains uncertain and will depend on several\nfactors, including whether additional or incremental U.S. Tariffs or other measures are announced or imposed, to what extent\nother countries implement tariffs or other retaliatory measures in response, and the overall magnitude and duration of these\nmeasures. If disputes and conflicts further escalate, actions by governments in response could be significantly more severe and\nrestrictive.\nMany of the Company\u2019s operations, retail stores and facilities, as well as critical business operations of the Company\u2019s suppliers\nand contract manufacturers, are in locations that are prone to earthquakes and other natural disasters. Global climate change is\nresulting in certain types of natural disasters and extreme weather occurring more frequently or with more intense effects. In\naddition, the Company\u2019s and its suppliers\u2019 operations, retail stores and facilities are subject to the risk of interruption by fire,\npower shortages, nuclear power plant accidents and other industrial accidents, terrorist attacks and other hostile acts,\nransomware and other cybersecurity attacks, labor disputes, public health issues and other events beyond the Company\u2019s\ncontrol.\nSuch events can make it difficult or impossible for the Company to manufacture and deliver products to its customers, create\ndelays and inefficiencies in the Company\u2019s supply and manufacturing chain, result in slowdowns and outages to the Company\u2019s\nservice offerings, increase the Company\u2019s costs, and negatively impact consumer spending and demand in affected areas.\nThe Company\u2019s operations are also subject to the risks of industrial accidents at its suppliers and contract manufacturers. While\nthe Company\u2019s suppliers are required to maintain safe working environments and operations, an industrial accident could occur\nand could result in serious injuries or loss of life, disruption to the Company\u2019s business, and harm to the Company\u2019s reputation.\nMajor public health issues, including pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic, have adversely affected, and could in the\nfuture materially adversely affect, the Company due to their impact on the global economy and demand for consumer products;\nthe imposition of protective public safety measures, such as stringent employee travel restrictions and limitations on freight\nservices and the movement of products between regions; and disruptions in the Company\u2019s operations, supply chain and sales\nand distribution channels, resulting in interruptions to the supply of current products and offering of existing services, and delays\nin production ramps of new products and development of new services.\nApple Inc. | 2025 Form 10-K | 6"}

Because the Company relies on single or limited sources for the supply and\nmanufacture of many critical components, a business interruption affecting such sources would exacerbate any negative\nconsequences to the Company. While the Company maintains insurance coverage for certain types of losses, such insurance\ncoverage may be insufficient to cover all losses that may arise. Any of the foregoing can materially adversely affect the\nCompany\u2019s business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price.\nGlobal markets for the Company\u2019s products and services are highly competitive and subject to rapid technological\nchange, and the Company may be unable to compete effectively in these markets.\nThe Company\u2019s products and services are offered in highly competitive global markets. These markets are characterized by\naggressive price competition, downward pressure on gross margins, continual improvement in product performance, and price\nsensitivity on the part of consumers and businesses. These markets are further defined by frequent introduction of new products\nand services, short product life cycles, evolving industry standards, and rapid adoption of technological advancements.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to compete successfully depends heavily on ensuring the continuing and timely introduction of innovative\nnew products, services and technologies to the marketplace. The Company designs and develops nearly the entire solution for\nits products, including the hardware, operating system, numerous software applications and related services. As a result, the\nCompany must make significant investments in R&D. These investments may not achieve expected returns, and the Company\nmay not be able to develop and market new products and services successfully.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to compete successfully also depends on the effective protection and enforcement of its intellectual\nproperty rights. Regulatory requirements, government investigations and litigation can force the Company to withdraw from, or\nmodify its products and services for, certain countries and limit its ability to derive value from, or to enjoin others from using, its\nintellectual property rights. Additionally, they may require the Company to share its innovations with competitors. Any of these\noutcomes can have a negative impact on the Company\u2019s competitive advantage and materially adversely affect its business,\nresults of operations, financial condition and stock price.\nThe Company currently holds a significant number of patents, trademarks and copyrights and has registered, and applied to\nregister, additional patents, trademarks and copyrights. In contrast, many of the Company\u2019s competitors seek to compete\nprimarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures, and by imitating the Company\u2019s products and infringing on\nits intellectual property. Effective intellectual property protection is not consistently available in every country in which the\nCompany operates. If the Company is unable to continue to develop and sell innovative new products with attractive margins or if\ncompetitors infringe on the Company\u2019s intellectual property, the Company\u2019s ability to maintain a competitive advantage could be\nmaterially adversely affected.\nThe Company\u2019s products and services face substantial competition from companies that have significant technical, marketing,\ndistribution and other resources, as well as established hardware, software and service offerings. In addition, the Company faces\nsignificant competition as competitors imitate the Company\u2019s product features and applications within their products to offer more\ncompetitive solutions. The Company also expects competition to intensify as competitors imitate the Company\u2019s approach to\nproviding components seamlessly within their offerings or work collaboratively to offer integrated solutions. Some of the\nCompany\u2019s competitors have broad product lines, low-priced products, large installed bases of active devices, and large\ncustomer bases. Competition has been particularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut prices and lowered product\nmargins. Certain competitors have the resources, experience or cost structures to provide products and services at little or no\nprofit or even at a loss. The Company has a minority market share in the global smartphone, personal computer, tablet and\nwearables markets, and some of the markets in which the Company competes have from time to time experienced little to no\ngrowth or contracted overall.\nIf the Company is unable to compete successfully, its business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock\nprice can be materially adversely affected.\nApple Inc. | 2025 Form 10-K | 7"}

The success of\nnew product and service introductions depends on a number of factors, including the Company\u2019s ability to recruit and retain\nhighly skilled personnel to execute on its strategic initiatives, and the timely and successful development and market acceptance\nof new products, services and technologies. Success also relies on the Company\u2019s ability to manage the risks associated with\nnew technologies and production ramp-up issues, the effective integration of third-party services and technologies into the\nCompany\u2019s products and services, the availability, delivery and performance of application software or other third-party support\nfor the Company\u2019s products and services, the effective management of manufacturing and other purchase commitments and the\nmanagement of inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand, and the availability of products in appropriate quantities\nand at expected costs to meet anticipated demand. Additionally, quality issues or other defects or deficiencies can adversely\naffect the success of new product and service introductions and market acceptance. New products, services and technologies\nmay replace or supersede existing offerings and may produce lower revenues and lower profit margins. The Company may not\nbe able to successfully manage future introductions and transitions of products and services, which can materially adversely\naffect the Company\u2019s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price.\nThe Company depends on component and product manufacturing and logistical services provided by outsourcing\npartners, many of which are located outside of the U.S.\nA significant majority of the Company\u2019s manufacturing is performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners located primarily\nin China mainland, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam, in addition to sourcing from partners and facilities located in\nthe U.S. The Company relies on single-source partners in the U.S., Asia and Europe to supply and manufacture many\ncomponents, and on partners primarily located in Asia, for final assembly of substantially all of the Company\u2019s hardware\nproducts. The Company has also outsourced much of its transportation and logistics management. While these arrangements\ncan lower operating costs, they also reduce the Company\u2019s direct control over production and distribution. Such diminished\ncontrol has from time to time had, and may in the future have, an adverse effect on the cost, quality or quantity of products\nmanufactured or services provided, or adversely affect the Company\u2019s flexibility to respond to changing conditions. Although\narrangements with these partners may contain provisions for product defect expense reimbursement, the Company generally\nremains responsible to the consumer for warranty and out-of-warranty service in the event of product defects and experiences\nunanticipated product defect liabilities from time to time. While the Company relies on its partners to adhere to its supplier code\nof conduct, violations of the supplier code of conduct occur from time to time and can materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s\nbusiness, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price.\nChanges or additions to the Company\u2019s supply chain require considerable time and resources and involve significant risks and\nuncertainties, including exposure to additional regulatory and operational risks.\nFuture operating results depend upon the Company\u2019s ability to obtain components in sufficient quantities on\ncommercially reasonable terms.\nBecause the Company currently obtains certain components from single or limited sources, the Company is subject to significant\nsupply and pricing risks. Many components, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to\nindustry-wide shortages and significant commodity pricing fluctuations that can materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s\nbusiness, results of operations, financial condition and stock price. For example, the global semiconductor industry has in the\npast experienced high demand and shortages of supply, which adversely affected the Company\u2019s ability to obtain sufficient\nquantities of components and products on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Such disruptions could occur in the future.\nAdditionally, the Company\u2019s new products often utilize custom components available from only one source. When a component\nor product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers\u2019 yields have matured or their\nmanufacturing capacities have increased. The Company may not be able to extend or renew agreements for the supply of\ncomponents on similar terms, or at all, and may not be successful in obtaining sufficient quantities from its suppliers in a timely\nmanner, or in identifying and obtaining sufficient quantities from an alternative source. In addition, component suppliers may fail,\nbe subject to consolidation within a particular industry, or decide to concentrate on the production of common components\ninstead of components customized to meet the Company\u2019s requirements, further limiting the Company\u2019s ability to obtain sufficient\nquantities of components on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Therefore, the Company remains subject to significant\nrisks of supply shortages and price increases that can materially adversely affect its business, results of operations, financial\ncondition and stock price.\nApple Inc. | 2025 Form 10-K | 8"}

Sophisticated operating system software and applications, such as those offered by the Company, often have issues\nthat can unexpectedly interfere with the intended operation of hardware or software products and services. Defects can also exist\nin components and products the Company purchases from third parties. Component defects could make the Company\u2019s\nproducts unsafe and create a risk of environmental or property damage and personal injury. These risks may increase as the\nCompany\u2019s products are introduced into specialized applications, including health. In addition, the Company\u2019s service offerings\ncan have quality issues and from time to time experience outages, service slowdowns or errors. As a result, from time to time the\nCompany\u2019s services have not performed as anticipated and may not meet customer expectations. The introduction of new and\ncomplex technologies, such as artificial intelligence features, can increase these and other safety risks, including exposing users\nto harmful, inaccurate or other negative content and experiences. The Company may not be able to detect and fix all issues and\ndefects in the hardware, software and services it offers, which can result in widespread technical and performance issues\naffecting the Company\u2019s products and services.

In addition, the Company can be exposed to product liability claims, recalls, product\nreplacements or modifications, write-offs of inventory, property, plant and equipment or intangible assets, and significant\nwarranty and other expenses, including litigation costs and regulatory fines. Quality problems can adversely affect the\nexperience for users of the Company\u2019s products and services, and result in harm to the Company\u2019s reputation, loss of\ncompetitive advantage, poor market acceptance, reduced demand for products and services, delay in new product and service\nintroductions and lost sales.\nThe Company is exposed to the risk of write-downs on the value of its inventory and other assets, in addition to purchase\ncommitment cancellation risk.\nThe Company records a write-down for product and component inventories if cost exceeds net realizable value. The Company\nreviews other assets, including capital assets held at its suppliers\u2019 facilities, inventory prepayments and other long-lived assets,\nfor impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the assets may not be recoverable. Although the Company believes\nits inventory, capital assets, inventory prepayments and other assets are currently recoverable, the Company may incur write-\ndowns, impairments and other charges given the rapid and unpredictable pace of product obsolescence in the industries in which\nthe Company competes.\nThe Company orders components for its products and builds inventory in advance of product announcements and shipments.\nManufacturing purchase obligations cover the Company\u2019s forecasted component and manufacturing requirements, typically for\nperiods up to 150 days. Because the Company\u2019s markets are volatile, competitive and subject to rapid technology and price\nchanges, there is a risk the Company will forecast incorrectly and order or produce excess or insufficient amounts of components\nor products, or not fully utilize purchase commitments. The Company accrues necessary cancellation fee reserves for orders of\nexcess products and components.\nThe Company relies on access to third-party intellectual property, which may not be available to the Company on\ncommercially reasonable terms, or at all.\nThe Company\u2019s products and services include technology or intellectual property that must be licensed from third parties. In\naddition, because of technological changes in the industries in which the Company currently competes or in the future may\ncompete, current extensive intellectual property coverage and the rapid rate of new intellectual property rights generation, the\nCompany\u2019s products and services may be alleged to infringe existing intellectual property rights of others. This risk may be\nexacerbated by the use of new and emerging technologies, including machine learning and artificial intelligence, which can\ninvolve, among other things, the acquisition and use of copyrighted materials for training as well as the potential reproduction of\ncopyrighted materials in their outputs. From time to time, the Company has been notified that it may be infringing certain\nintellectual property rights of third parties. The Company is not always able to obtain all necessary licenses to third-party\nintellectual property rights on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Failure to obtain the right to use third-party intellectual\nproperty, or to use such intellectual property on commercially reasonable terms, can require the Company to modify certain\nproducts, services or features or preclude the Company from selling certain products or services and expose the Company to\nsignificant licensing costs, all of which can materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, reputation, results of operations,\nfinancial condition and stock price.\nApple Inc. | 2025 Form 10-K | 9"}

Some third-party content providers\nand distributors currently or in the future may offer competing products and services, and can take actions to make it difficult or\nimpossible for the Company to license or otherwise distribute their content. Other content owners, providers or distributors may\nseek to limit the Company\u2019s access to, or increase the cost of, such content. The Company may be unable to continue to offer a\nwide variety of content at commercially reasonable prices with acceptable usage rules.\nThe Company also produces its own digital content, which can be costly to produce due to intense and increasing competition for\ntalent, content and subscribers, and may fail to appeal to the Company\u2019s customers.\nThe Company\u2019s success depends largely on the talents and efforts of its team members, the continued service and\navailability of highly skilled employees, including key personnel, and the Company\u2019s ability to nurture its distinctive and\ninclusive culture.\nMuch of the Company\u2019s future success depends on the talents and efforts of its team members and the continued availability and\nservice of key personnel, including its Chief Executive Officer, executive team and other highly skilled employees. Experienced\npersonnel in the technology industry are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense, especially in Silicon Valley,\nwhere most of the Company\u2019s key personnel are located. Periods of intense competition for talent in particular fields can lead to\nincreased costs as the Company seeks to offer competitive compensation to recruit and retain highly skilled employees. In\naddition to competition for talent, workforce dynamics are constantly evolving and the Company must navigate changes\neffectively in order to achieve its strategic initiatives. Laws and regulations, including immigration, labor and employment laws\nand export controls, among others, can materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to recruit and retain a highly skilled,\nglobal workforce.

Some transactions, including investments and acquisitions, are exposed to additional risks, including failing\nto obtain required regulatory approvals on a timely basis or at all, a counterparty\u2019s failure to perform or deliver as anticipated, or\nthe imposition of onerous conditions that could delay or prevent the Company from completing a transaction or otherwise limit\nthe Company\u2019s ability to fully realize the anticipated benefits of a transaction. New business strategies and ventures are\ninherently risky and may not be successful. The Company\u2019s business strategies and investments may not be successful, which\ncould materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price.\nLegal and Regulatory Compliance Risks\nThe Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted by unfavorable\nresults of legal proceedings or government investigations.\nThe Company is subject to various claims, legal proceedings and government investigations that have arisen in the ordinary\ncourse of business and have not yet been fully resolved, and new matters may arise in the future. In addition, the Company\nenters into agreements that include indemnification provisions that can subject the Company to costs and damages in the event\nof a claim against an indemnified third party. The number of claims, legal proceedings and government investigations involving\nthe Company, and the alleged magnitude of such claims, proceedings and government investigations, has generally increased\nover time and may continue to increase.\nThe Company has faced and continues to face a significant number of patent claims relating to its standards-enabled products,\nand new claims may arise in the future, including as a result of new legal or regulatory frameworks. For example, technology,\ndata and other intellectual property asset\u2013holding companies frequently assert their intellectual property rights and seek royalties\nand often enter into litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. These risks,\nand the risks of novel claims being attempted, may be exacerbated as new and emerging technologies, including machine\nlearning and artificial intelligence, are further integrated into the Company\u2019s products and services. The Company is vigorously\ndefending infringement actions in courts in several U.S. jurisdictions, as well as internationally in various countries. The plaintiffs\nin these actions frequently seek broad injunctive relief and substantial damages.\nRegardless of the merit of particular claims, defending against litigation or responding to government investigations can be\nexpensive, time-consuming and disruptive to the Company\u2019s operations. In recognition of these considerations, the Company\nmay enter into agreements or other arrangements to settle litigation and resolve such challenges. However, such agreements\nmay not always be available on acceptable terms, and litigation may still arise. Such agreements can also significantly reduce\nthe Company\u2019s revenue and increase the Company\u2019s cost of sales and operating expenses, materially adversely affecting the\nCompany\u2019s business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price. Additionally, such agreements may require the\nCompany to change its business practices and limit the Company\u2019s ability to offer certain products and services.\nApple Inc. | 2025 Form 10-K | 12"}

Further,\nsuch an outcome can result in significant monetary damages, disgorgement of revenue or profits, remedial corporate measures\nor injunctive relief against the Company. Adverse resolution of legal matters has from time to time required, and can in the future\nrequire, the Company to change its business practices. It can also limit the Company\u2019s ability to enjoin others from using, or to\nderive value from, its intellectual property rights, and to develop, manufacture, use, import or offer for sale certain products and\nservices, all of which could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, reputation, results of operations, financial\ncondition and stock price.\nWhile the Company maintains insurance coverage for certain types of claims, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to\ncover all losses or all types of claims that may arise.\nThe Company is subject to complex and changing laws and regulations worldwide, which exposes the Company to\npotential liabilities, increased costs and other adverse effects on the Company\u2019s business.\nThe Company\u2019s global operations are subject to complex and changing laws and regulations worldwide on subjects including\nantitrust; privacy, data security and data localization; online safety; age verification; consumer protection; advertising, sales,\nbilling and e-commerce; financial services and technology; product liability; intellectual property ownership and infringement;\ndigital platforms; machine learning and artificial intelligence; internet, telecommunications and mobile communications; media,\ntelevision, film and digital content; availability of third-party software applications and services; labor and employment;\nanticorruption; import, export and trade; foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions; anti\u2013money laundering;\nforeign ownership and investment; national security; tax; and environmental, health and safety, including electronic waste,\nrecycling, product design and climate change.\nCompliance with these laws and regulations is onerous and expensive. New and changing laws, regulations, executive orders,\ndirectives, and enforcement priorities can adversely affect the Company\u2019s business by increasing the Company\u2019s costs, limiting\nthe Company\u2019s ability to offer a product, service or feature to customers, imposing changes to the design of the Company\u2019s\nproducts and services, impacting customer demand for the Company\u2019s products and services, and requiring changes to the\nCompany\u2019s business or supply chain. New and changing laws, regulations, executive orders, directives, and enforcement\npriorities can also create uncertainty about how such laws and regulations will be interpreted and applied. If the Company is\nfound to have violated such laws and regulations, it could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, reputation, results\nof operations, financial condition and stock price.\nRisks and costs related to new and changing laws, regulations, executive orders, directives, and enforcement priorities increase\nas the Company\u2019s products and services are introduced into specialized applications, including health and financial services, or\nas the Company expands the use of technologies, such as machine learning and artificial intelligence features, and must\nnavigate new legal, regulatory and ethical considerations relating to such technologies.\nRegulatory changes and other actions that materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business may be announced with little or\nno advance notice and the Company may not be able to effectively mitigate all adverse impacts from such measures. For\nexample, the Company is subject to changing regulations relating to the export and import of its products. The Company\u2019s\nprograms, policies and procedures may not be effective in preventing a violation or a claim of a violation. As a result, the\nCompany\u2019s products could be banned, delayed or prohibited from importation, which could materially adversely affect the\nCompany\u2019s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price.\nVaried stakeholder expectations about social and other issues expose the Company to potential liabilities, increased\ncosts, reputational harm, and other adverse effects on the Company\u2019s business.\nVarious stakeholders, including governments, regulators, investors, employees, customers and others, have differing\nexpectations about a wide range of social and other issues related to the Company\u2019s business.

The Company expects to make further business changes in the future.\nFor example, in the U.S., the Company has implemented changes to how developers communicate with consumers within apps\non the U.S. storefront of the iOS and iPadOS App Store regarding alternative purchasing mechanisms and is currently subject to\na court order preventing it from imposing any commission or fee on certain purchases that consumers make.\nGlobally, several jurisdictions have adopted, or may in the future adopt, competition-related laws and regulations imposing wide-\nranging obligations on technology companies and significant limitations on businesses, including the Company. For example, the\nCompany has implemented changes to iOS, iPadOS, the App Store and Safari\u00ae in the EU as it seeks to comply with the Digital\nMarkets Act (\u201cDMA\u201d), including new business terms and alternative fee structures for iOS and iPadOS apps, alternative methods\nof distribution for iOS and iPadOS apps, alternative payment processing for apps across the Company\u2019s operating systems, and\nadditional tools and application programming interfaces for developers. The Company has also continued to make changes to its\ncompliance plan in response to feedback and engagement with the Commission. Although the Company\u2019s compliance plan is\nintended to address the DMA\u2019s obligations, it has been challenged by the Commission and may be challenged further by private\nlitigants. The DMA provides for significant fines and penalties for noncompliance. While the changes introduced by the Company\nin the EU are intended to reduce new privacy and security risks that the DMA poses to EU users, many risks will remain.\nChanges to the Company\u2019s business in response to the DMA or other laws and regulations could materially adversely affect the\nCompany\u2019s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price.\nThe Company is also currently subject to antitrust investigations and litigation in various jurisdictions around the world, which can\nresult in legal proceedings and claims against the Company that could, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse\nimpact on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price. For example, the Company is\nsubject to civil antitrust lawsuits in the U.S. alleging monopolization or attempted monopolization in the markets for \u201cperformance\nsmartphones\u201d and \u201csmartphones\u201d generally in violation of U.S. antitrust laws. In addition, the Company is the subject of\ninvestigations in Europe and other jurisdictions relating to App Store terms and conditions. If such investigations or litigation are\nresolved against the Company, the Company can be exposed to significant fines and may be required to make further changes\nto its business practices, all of which could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, reputation, results of operations,\nfinancial condition and stock price.\nFurther, the Company has commercial relationships with other companies in the technology industry that are or may become\nsubject to investigations and litigation that, if resolved against those other companies, could materially adversely affect the\nCompany\u2019s commercial relationships with those business partners and materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s business,\nresults of operations, financial condition and stock price. For example, the Company earns revenue from licensing arrangements\nwith Google LLC (\u201cGoogle\u201d) and other companies to offer their search services on the Company\u2019s platforms and applications,\nand certain of these arrangements are currently subject to government investigations and legal proceedings. On August 5, 2024,\nGoogle was found to have violated U.S. antitrust laws. In connection with this finding, on September 2, 2025, the U.S. District\nCourt for the District of Columbia (\u201cD.C. District Court\u201d) ordered certain remedies. The court\u2019s order is subject to further\nproceedings before the D.C. District Court, which may result in changes to the interpretation or application of the remedies\nordered by the court, as well as new or changed remedies being ordered. The court\u2019s order is also subject to appeal by both the\nU.S. Department of Justice (\u201cDOJ\u201d) and Google. A reversal of the order on appeal could result in imposition of certain remedies\ninitially proposed by the DOJ, such as those prohibiting Google from offering the Company commercial terms for search\ndistribution. If implemented, these remedies could materially adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to earn revenue from such\nlicensing arrangements.\nThe Company\u2019s business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price can be materially adversely affected,\nindividually or in the aggregate, by the outcomes of such investigations, litigation or changes to laws and regulations in the\nfuture. Changes to the Company\u2019s business practices to comply with new laws and regulations or in connection with legal\nproceedings can negatively impact the reputation of the Company\u2019s products for privacy and security. Such changes in business\npractices can also otherwise adversely affect the experience for users of the Company\u2019s products and services, and result in\nharm to the Company\u2019s reputation, loss of competitive advantage, poor market acceptance, reduced demand for products and\nservices, lost sales, and lower profit margins.\nApple Inc. | 2025 Form 10-K | 14"}

In many cases, these laws apply not only to third-party transactions, but\nalso restrict transfers of personal data among the Company and its international subsidiaries. Several jurisdictions have passed\nlaws in this area, and additional jurisdictions are considering imposing additional restrictions or have laws that are pending.\nThese laws continue to develop and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Complying with emerging and changing\nrequirements causes the Company to incur substantial costs and has required and may in the future require the Company to\nchange its business practices.

Such a failure or perceived failure could also\nresult in reputational impacts, ongoing audit requirements and significant legal liability. The risks of inadvertent disclosure of\npersonal data can increase with the introduction of new and complex technologies, such as artificial intelligence features, further\nexacerbating such risks.\nIn addition to the risks generally relating to the collection, use, retention, protection and transfer of personal data, the Company is\nalso subject to specific obligations relating to the collection and processing of data associated with minors, as well as information\nconsidered sensitive under applicable laws, such as health, biometric, financial and payment card data.

If the\nCompany fails to adequately comply with these rules and requirements, the Company can be subject to litigation or government\ninvestigations, can be liable for associated investigatory expenses, and can incur significant fees or fines.\nThe Company is also subject to new and changing laws and regulations regarding online safety, including enhanced protections\nfor minors and mandatory age verification requirements. These laws and regulations can increase regulatory risks by requiring\ncomplex compliance measures and significant modifications to the Company\u2019s products, services and operations, and may lead\nto operational disruptions, heightened privacy and data security risks, increased costs and potential liability and fines, all of which\ncan have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations and stock price.\nFinancial Risks\nThe Company\u2019s net sales and gross margins are subject to volatility and downward pressure due to a variety of factors.\nThe Company\u2019s gross margins vary significantly across its products, services, geographic segments and distribution channels\nand can change over time. The Company\u2019s net sales and gross margins are subject to volatility and downward pressure due to a\nvariety of factors, including: continued industry-wide global product pricing pressures and product pricing actions that the\nCompany may take in response to such pressures; increased competition; the Company\u2019s ability to effectively stimulate demand\nfor certain of its products and services; compressed product life cycles; supply shortages; potential increases in the cost of\ncomponents, outside manufacturing services, and developing, acquiring and delivering content for the Company\u2019s services; the\nCompany\u2019s ability to manage product quality and warranty costs effectively; shifts in the mix of products and services, or in the\ngeographic, currency or channel mix, including to the extent that regulatory changes require the Company to modify its product\nand service offerings; fluctuations in foreign exchange rates; inflation and other macroeconomic pressures; the imposition of new\nor increased tariffs and other trade restrictions, their overall magnitude and duration, and retaliatory actions in response; and the\nintroduction of new products or services, including new products or services with lower profit margins. These and other factors\ncould have a materially adverse impact on the Company\u2019s results of operations, financial condition and stock price. Further, the\nCompany generates a significant portion of its net sales from a single product category and a decline in demand for that product\ncould significantly impact net sales and gross margins.\nThe Company\u2019s financial performance is subject to risks associated with changes in the value of the U.S. dollar relative\nto local currencies.\nThe Company\u2019s primary exposure to movements in foreign exchange rates relates to non\u2013U.S. dollar\u2013denominated sales, cost\nof sales and operating expenses worldwide. Gross margins on the Company\u2019s products in foreign countries and on products that\ninclude components obtained from foreign suppliers have in the past been adversely affected and could in the future be\nmaterially adversely affected by foreign exchange rate fluctuations.\nThe weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar adversely affects the U.S. dollar value of the Company\u2019s foreign\ncurrency\u2013denominated sales and earnings, and generally leads the Company to raise international pricing, potentially reducing\ndemand for the Company\u2019s products. In some circumstances, for competitive or other reasons, the Company may decide not to\nraise international pricing to offset the U.S. dollar\u2019s strengthening, which would adversely affect the U.S. dollar value of the gross\nmargins the Company earns on foreign currency\u2013denominated sales.\nApple Inc. | 2025 Form 10-K | 15"}

Additionally, strengthening of foreign currencies may\nincrease the Company\u2019s cost of product components denominated in those currencies, thus adversely affecting gross margins.\nThe Company uses derivative instruments, such as foreign currency forward and option contracts, to hedge certain exposures to\nfluctuations in foreign exchange rates.

The Company\u2019s exposure to credit and\ncollectibility risk on its trade receivables is higher in certain international markets. The Company also has unsecured vendor non-\ntrade receivables resulting from purchases of components by outsourcing partners and other vendors that manufacture\nsubassemblies or assemble final products for the Company. In addition, the Company has made prepayments associated with\nlong-term supply agreements to secure supply of inventory components. As of September 27, 2025, the Company\u2019s vendor non-\ntrade receivables were concentrated among a few individual vendors located primarily in Asia. If the Company is unable to\nmonitor and limit exposure to credit risk on its trade and vendor non-trade receivables, as well as long-term prepayments, the\nCompany\u2019s results of operations, financial condition and stock price could be materially adversely affected.\nThe Company is subject to changes in tax rates, the adoption of new U.S. or international tax legislation and exposure to\nadditional tax liabilities.\nThe Company is subject to taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions, including Ireland and Singapore, where a\nnumber of the Company\u2019s subsidiaries are organized. Due to economic and political conditions, tax laws and tax rates for income\ntaxes and other non-income taxes in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change. For example, the Organisation for\nEconomic Co-operation and Development continues to advance proposals for modernizing international tax rules, including the\nintroduction of global minimum tax standards. The Company\u2019s effective tax rates are affected by changes in the mix of earnings\nin countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, the introduction of\nnew taxes, and changes in tax laws or their interpretation. The application of tax laws may be uncertain, require significant\njudgment and be subject to differing interpretations.\nThe Company is also subject to the examination of its tax returns and other tax matters by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service\nand other tax authorities and governmental bodies. The Company regularly assesses the likelihood of an adverse outcome\nresulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for taxes. The outcome of such examinations is\ninherently uncertain. If the Company\u2019s effective tax rates were to increase, or if the ultimate determination of the Company\u2019s\ntaxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, the Company\u2019s business, results of operations, financial\ncondition and stock price could be materially adversely affected.\nApple Inc. | 2025 Form 10-K | 16"}

If the Commission makes a final determination in the Article 6(4)\nInvestigation that there has been a violation, it can issue a cease and desist order and may impose fines up to 10% of the\nCompany\u2019s annual worldwide net sales. The Commission may also seek to impose additional fines if it deems that the Company\nhas violated a cease and desist order. The Company believes that it complies with the DMA and has continued to make changes\nto its compliance plan in response to feedback and engagement with the Commission.\nDepartment of Justice Lawsuit\nOn March 21, 2024, the DOJ and a number of state and district attorneys general filed a civil antitrust lawsuit in the U.S. District\nCourt for the District of New Jersey against the Company alleging monopolization or attempted monopolization in the markets for\n\u201cperformance smartphones\u201d and \u201csmartphones\u201d in violation of U.S. antitrust laws. The DOJ is seeking equitable relief to redress\nthe alleged anticompetitive behavior. In addition, various civil litigation matters have been filed in state and federal courts in the\nU.S. alleging similar violations of U.S. antitrust laws and seeking monetary damages and other nonmonetary relief. The\nCompany believes it has substantial defenses and intends to vigorously defend itself.\nEpic Games\nEpic Games, Inc. filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California (\u201cCalifornia District Court\u201d) against\nthe Company alleging violations of federal and state antitrust laws and California\u2019s unfair competition law based upon the\nCompany\u2019s operation of its App Store. The California District Court found that certain provisions of the Company\u2019s App Review\nGuidelines violate California\u2019s unfair competition law and issued an injunction (the \u201c2021 Injunction\u201d) enjoining the Company from\nprohibiting developers from including in their apps buttons, external links, or other calls to action that direct customers to\npurchasing mechanisms other than the Company\u2019s in-app purchase system. The 2021 Injunction applies to apps on the U.S.\nstorefronts of the iOS and iPadOS App Stores. On January 16, 2024, the Company implemented a plan to comply with the 2021\nInjunction and filed a statement of compliance with the California District Court. On September 30, 2024, the Company filed a\nmotion with the California District Court to narrow or vacate the 2021 Injunction. On April 30, 2025, the California District Court\nfound the Company to be in violation of the 2021 Injunction and enjoined the Company from imposing any commission or any fee\non purchases that consumers make outside an app; restricting, conditioning, limiting, or prohibiting how developers guide\nconsumers to purchases outside an app; or otherwise interfering with a consumer\u2019s choice to proceed in or out of an app. The\nCalifornia District Court also denied the Company\u2019s motion to narrow or vacate the 2021 Injunction and referred the Company to\nthe U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of California for a determination whether criminal contempt proceedings are\nappropriate. The Company will continue to vigorously defend its actions and employees, and has appealed the California District\nCourt\u2019s most recent decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit (\u201cNinth Circuit Court\u201d). Although the Company\u2019s\nrequest to stay the decision pending appeal was denied, the Ninth Circuit Court has agreed to consider the Company\u2019s appeal\non an expedited basis, with oral arguments heard in October 2025.\nOther Legal Proceedings\nThe Company is subject to other legal proceedings and claims that have not been fully resolved and that have arisen in the\nordinary course of business. The Company settled certain matters during the fourth quarter of 2025 that did not individually or in\nthe aggregate have a material impact on the Company\u2019s financial condition or operating results. The outcome of litigation is\ninherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company in a reporting period for amounts above\nmanagement\u2019s expectations, the Company\u2019s financial condition and operating results for that reporting period could be materially\nadversely affected.\nItem 4.

Various modifications to the U.S.\nTariffs have been announced and further changes could be made in the future, which may include additional sector-based tariffs\nor other measures.

The Company records a liability when it is probable a loss has been incurred and the amount is\nreasonably estimable, the determination of which requires significant judgment. Resolution of legal matters in a manner\ninconsistent with management\u2019s expectations could have a material impact on the Company\u2019s financial condition and operating\nresults.\nItem 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nThe Company is exposed to economic risk from interest rates and foreign exchange rates. The Company uses various strategies\nto manage these risks; however, they may still impact the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements.\nInterest Rate Risk\nThe Company is primarily exposed to fluctuations in U.S. interest rates and their impact on the Company\u2019s investment portfolio\nand term debt. Increases in interest rates will negatively affect the fair value of the Company\u2019s investment portfolio and increase\nthe interest expense on the Company\u2019s term debt. To protect against interest rate risk, the Company may use derivative\ninstruments, offset interest rate\u2013sensitive assets and liabilities, or control duration of the investment and term debt portfolios.\nThe following table sets forth potential impacts on the Company\u2019s investment portfolio and term debt, including the effects of any\nassociated derivatives, that would result from a hypothetical increase in relevant interest rates as of September 27, 2025 and\nSeptember 28, 2024 (dollars in millions):\nInterest Rate Hypothetical Interest\nSensitive Instrument Rate Increase Potential Impact 2025 2024\nInvestment portfolio 100 basis points, all tenors Decline in fair value $ 2,416 $ 2,755\nTerm debt 100 basis points, all tenors Increase in annual interest expense $ 129 $ 139\nForeign Exchange Rate Risk\nThe Company\u2019s exposure to foreign exchange rate risk relates primarily to the Company being a net receiver of currencies other\nthan the U.S. dollar. Changes in exchange rates, and in particular a strengthening of the U.S. dollar, will negatively affect the\nCompany\u2019s net sales and gross margins as expressed in U.S. dollars. Fluctuations in exchange rates may also affect the fair\nvalues of certain of the Company\u2019s assets and liabilities. To protect against foreign exchange rate risk, the Company may use\nderivative instruments, offset exposures, or adjust local currency pricing of its products and services. However, the Company\nmay choose to not hedge certain foreign currency exposures for a variety of reasons, including accounting considerations or\nprohibitive cost.\nThe Company applied a value-at-risk (\u201cVAR\u201d) model to its foreign currency derivative positions to assess the potential impact of\nfluctuations in exchange rates. The VAR model used a Monte Carlo simulation. The VAR is the maximum expected loss in fair\nvalue, for a given confidence interval, to the Company\u2019s foreign currency derivative positions due to adverse movements in rates.\nBased on the results of the model, the Company estimates, with 95% confidence, a maximum one-day loss in fair value of $590\nmillion and $538 million as of September 27, 2025 and September 28, 2024, respectively. Changes in the Company\u2019s underlying\nforeign currency exposures, which were excluded from the assessment, generally offset changes in the fair values of the\nCompany\u2019s foreign currency derivatives.\nApple Inc. | 2025 Form 10-K | 27"}

An additional week is\nincluded in the first fiscal quarter every five or six years to realign the Company\u2019s fiscal quarters with calendar quarters, which\noccurred in the first fiscal quarter of 2023.

Control is generally transferred when the Company has a present right to payment and title and the\nsignificant risks and rewards of ownership of products or services are transferred to its customers. For most of the Company\u2019s\nProducts net sales, control transfers when products are shipped. For the Company\u2019s Services net sales, control transfers over\ntime as services are delivered. Payment for Products and Services net sales is collected within a short period following transfer\nof control or commencement of delivery of services, as applicable.\nThe Company records reductions to Products net sales related to future product returns, price protection and other customer\nincentive programs based on the Company\u2019s expectations and historical experience.\nFor arrangements with multiple performance obligations, which represent promises within an arrangement that are distinct, the\nCompany allocates revenue to all distinct performance obligations based on their relative stand-alone selling prices (\u201cSSPs\u201d).\nWhen available, the Company uses observable prices to determine SSPs. When observable prices are not available, SSPs are\nestablished that reflect the Company\u2019s best estimates of what the selling prices of the performance obligations would be if they\nwere sold regularly on a stand-alone basis. The Company\u2019s process for estimating SSPs without observable prices considers\nmultiple factors that may vary depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each performance obligation\nincluding, where applicable, prices charged by the Company for similar offerings, market trends in the pricing for similar offerings,\nproduct-specific business objectives and the estimated cost to provide the performance obligation.\nThe Company has identified the performance obligations regularly included in arrangements involving the sale of iPhone, Mac\nand iPad. The first material performance obligation, which represents the substantial portion of the allocated sales price, is the\nhardware and bundled software delivered at the time of sale. The second material performance obligation is the right to receive\ncertain product-related bundled services, which include iCloud\u00ae, Siri\u00ae and Maps. The Company allocates revenue and any\nrelated discounts to all of its performance obligations based on their relative SSPs. Because the Company lacks observable\nprices for product-related bundled services, the allocation of revenue is based on the Company\u2019s estimated SSPs. Revenue\nallocated to the delivered hardware and bundled software is recognized when control has transferred to the customer, which\ngenerally occurs when the product is shipped. Revenue allocated to product-related bundled services is deferred and recognized\non a straight-line basis over the estimated period they are expected to be provided.\nFor certain long-term service arrangements, the Company has performance obligations for services it has not yet delivered. For\nthese arrangements, the Company does not have a right to bill for the undelivered services. The Company has determined that\nany unbilled consideration relates entirely to the value of the undelivered services. Accordingly, the Company has not recognized\nrevenue, and does not disclose amounts, related to these undelivered services.\nFor the sale of third-party products where the Company obtains control of the product before transferring it to the customer, the\nCompany recognizes revenue based on the gross amount billed to customers. The Company considers multiple factors when\ndetermining whether it obtains control of third-party products, including evaluating if it can establish the price of the product,\nretains inventory risk for tangible products or has the responsibility for ensuring acceptability of the product. For third-party\napplications sold through the App Store, the Company does not obtain control of the product before transferring it to the\ncustomer. Therefore, the Company accounts for all third-party application\u2013related sales on a net basis by recognizing in Services\nnet sales only the commission it retains.\nApple Inc. | 2025 Form 10-K | 35"}

The\nCompany classifies marketable debt securities as either current or non-current based on each instrument\u2019s underlying maturity.\nDerivative Instruments and Hedging\nThe Company may use derivative instruments to partially offset its business exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risk.\nHowever, the Company may choose not to hedge certain exposures for a variety of reasons including accounting considerations\nor the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures. There can be no assurance the hedges will offset more than a\nportion of the financial impact resulting from movements in foreign exchange or interest rates.\nAll derivative instruments are recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value. The accounting treatment for derivative\ngains and losses is based on intended use and hedge designation.\nGains and losses arising from amounts that are included in the assessment of cash flow hedge effectiveness are initially deferred\nin accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) and subsequently reclassified into earnings when the hedged transaction\naffects earnings, and in the same line item in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Gains and losses arising from amounts\nthat are included in the assessment of fair value hedge effectiveness are recognized in the Consolidated Statements of\nOperations line item to which the hedge relates along with offsetting losses and gains related to the change in value of the\nhedged item.\nFor derivative instruments designated as cash flow and fair value hedges, amounts excluded from the assessment of hedge\neffectiveness are recognized on a straight-line basis over the life of the hedge in the Consolidated Statements of Operations line\nitem to which the hedge relates. Changes in the fair value of amounts excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness are\nrecognized in other comprehensive income/(loss).\nGains and losses arising from changes in the fair values of derivative instruments that are not designated as accounting hedges\nare recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nThe Company classifies cash flows related to derivative instruments in the same section of the Consolidated Statements of Cash\nFlows as the items being hedged, which are generally classified as operating activities.\nForeign Exchange Rate Risk\nTo protect gross margins from fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, the Company may use forwards, options or other\ninstruments, and may designate these instruments as cash flow hedges. The Company generally hedges portions of its\nforecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenue and inventory purchases, typically for up to 12 months.\nTo protect the Company\u2019s foreign currency\u2013denominated term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in foreign\nexchange rates, the Company may use forwards, cross-currency swaps or other instruments. The Company designates these\ninstruments as either cash flow or fair value hedges. As of September 27, 2025, the maximum length of time over which the\nCompany is hedging its exposure to the variability in future cash flows for term debt\u2013related foreign currency transactions is 17\nyears.\nThe Company may also use derivative instruments that are not designated as accounting hedges to protect gross margins from\ncertain fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, as well as to offset a portion of the foreign currency gains and losses generated by\nthe remeasurement of certain assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies.\nInterest Rate Risk\nTo protect the Company\u2019s term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in interest rates, the Company may use interest\nrate swaps, options or other instruments.

The State Aid Decision ordered Ireland to calculate and recover additional taxes from the Company for the\nperiod June 2003 through December 2014. Irish legislative changes, effective as of January 2015, eliminated the application of\nthe tax opinions from that date forward.\nThe Company and Ireland appealed the State Aid Decision to the General Court of the Court of Justice of the European Union\n(\u201cGeneral Court\u201d).

Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial\nstatements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included\nexamining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.

(the \u201cCompany\u201d) maintained, in all material respects, effective\ninternal control over financial reporting as of September 27, 2025, based on the COSO criteria.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)\n(\u201cPCAOB\u201d), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of September 27, 2025 and September 28, 2024, the related\nconsolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, shareholders\u2019 equity and cash flows for each of the three years\nin the period ended September 27, 2025, and the related notes and our report dated October 31, 2025 expressed an unqualified\nopinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company\u2019s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its\nassessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management\u2019s Annual\nReport on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company\u2019s internal control\nover financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be\nindependent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and\nregulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the\naudit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all\nmaterial respects.\nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material\nweakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk,\nand performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a\nreasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the\nreliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally\naccepted accounting principles. A company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that\n(1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions\nof the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit\npreparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and\nexpenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the\ncompany; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or\ndisposition of the company\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,\nprojections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate\nbecause of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nSan Jose, California\nOctober 31, 2025\nApple Inc. | 2025 Form 10-K | 51"}

Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure\nNone.\nItem 9A. Controls and Procedures\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nBased on an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of the Company\u2019s management, the Company\u2019s principal\nexecutive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that the Company\u2019s disclosure controls and procedures as defined\nin Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act were effective as of September 27, 2025 to provide reasonable\nassurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is\n(i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms and\n(ii) accumulated and communicated to the Company\u2019s management, including its principal executive officer and principal\nfinancial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nInherent Limitations over Internal Controls\nThe Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of\nfinancial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP. The Company\u2019s\ninternal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:\n(i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and\ndispositions of the Company\u2019s assets;\n(ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial\nstatements in accordance with GAAP, and that the Company\u2019s receipts and expenditures are being made only in\naccordance with authorizations of the Company\u2019s management and directors; and\n(iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or\ndisposition of the Company\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nManagement, including the Company\u2019s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that the Company\u2019s\ninternal controls will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can\nprovide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a\ncontrol system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative\nto their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of internal controls can provide absolute\nassurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. Also, any evaluation of the effectiveness of\ncontrols in future periods are subject to the risk that those internal controls may become inadequate because of changes in\nbusiness conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nManagement\u2019s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThe Company\u2019s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting\n(as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of the\nCompany\u2019s internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria set forth in Internal Control \u2013 Integrated Framework\nissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework). Based on the Company\u2019s\nassessment, management has concluded that its internal control over financial reporting was effective as of September 27, 2025\nto provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in\naccordance with GAAP. The Company\u2019s independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst & Young LLP, has issued an audit\nreport on the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting, which appears in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere were no changes in the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting during the fourth quarter of 2025, which were\nidentified in connection with management\u2019s evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the\nExchange Act, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company\u2019s internal control over\nfinancial reporting.\nApple Inc. | 2025 Form 10-K | 52"}

Legal defeasance or covenant defeasance, as the case may be, will be conditioned upon, among other\nthings, the irrevocable deposit by us with the trustee, in trust, of an amount in U.S. dollars, or U.S. government\nobligations (as such term is modified below), or both, applicable to the Notes of that series which through the\nscheduled payment of principal and interest in accordance with their terms will provide money in an amount sufficient\nto pay the principal or premium, if any, and interest on the Notes on the scheduled due dates therefor.\nIf we effect covenant defeasance with respect to the Notes of any series, the amount in U.S. dollars, or U.S.\ngovernment obligations (as such term is modified below), or both, on deposit with the trustee will be sufficient, in the\nopinion of a nationally recognized firm of independent accountants, to pay amounts due on the Notes of that series at\nthe time of the stated maturity but may not be sufficient to pay amounts due on the Notes of that series at the time of\nthe acceleration resulting from such event of default. However, we would remain liable to make payment of such\namounts due at the time of acceleration.\nWith respect to the 2025 Notes, the 2026 Notes, the 2027 Notes, the 1.375% 2029 Notes and the 2031\nNotes, the term \u201cU.S. government obligations\u201d shall instead mean (x) any security that is (i) a direct obligation of the\nGerman government or (ii) an obligation of a person controlled or supervised by and acting as an agency or\ninstrumentality of the German government the payment of which is fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the\nGerman government or the central bank of the German government, which, in either case (x)(i) or (ii), is not callable\nor redeemable at the option of the issuer thereof, and (y) certificates, depositary receipts or other instruments which\nevidence a direct ownership interest in obligations described in clause (x)(i) or (x)(ii) above or in any specific principal\nor interest payments due in respect thereof.\nWith respect to the 3.050% 2029 Notes and the 2042 Notes, the term \u201cU.S. government obligations\u201d shall\ninstead mean (x) any security that is (i) a direct obligation of the United Kingdom government or (ii) an obligation of a\nperson controlled or supervised by and acting as an agency or instrumentality of the United Kingdom government the\npayment of which is fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the United Kingdom government or the central bank of\nthe United Kingdom government, which, in either case (x)(i) or (ii), is not callable or redeemable at the option of the\nissuer thereof, and (y) certificates, depositary receipts or other instruments which evidence a direct ownership interest\nin obligations described in clause (x)(i) or (x)(ii) above or in any specific principal or interest payments due in respect\nthereof.\nWe will be required to deliver to the trustee an opinion of counsel that the deposit and related defeasance\nwill not cause the holders and beneficial owners of the Notes of that series to recognize income, gain or loss for\nfederal income tax purposes. If we elect legal defeasance, that opinion of counsel must be based upon a ruling from\nthe U.S. Internal Revenue Service or a change in law to that effect.\nWe may exercise our legal defeasance option notwithstanding our prior exercise of our covenant\ndefeasance option.\n13"}
